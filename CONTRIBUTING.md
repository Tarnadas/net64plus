First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

# How to contribute to Net64+

Here are some rules and guidelines for contributing.

## Make an issue

You should always use GitHub issues to talk about things that you want to be implemented or bugs that you found.
If you are just writing in some chat app like Discord, it is very likely that no-one who is responsible for the code will ever see it, so please use GitHub as a discussion platform.

#### Did you find a bug?

- Check our issue section, if there is already an opened issue and give your feedback
- If there is not yet an issue, please don't hesitate opening a new one

#### Do you want to have a new feature?

Basically the same

#### Do you want to make your own code changes?

Before you start coding with the hope that your code will be merged, you should start a discussion about what you want to implement. Maybe we don't want or need it for some reason and we don't want you to work for nothing.

## Commit messages

- Try to describe your changes as closely as possible
- If there is an issue related to your changes, name it in your commit header

## Clean Code

We encourage you to read ![JavaScript Clean Code Principles](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) and use it as a guideline while coding.

## Styleguide

We use ![JavaScript Standard Style](standardjs.com).

ESLint is set up to help you out on all linting rules.
