                    Connection is the base class for all connections that Hazel can make. It provides common functionality and a

                typically requires a smaller number of protocol bytes than other methods. There is also typically less

                Sending data reliably means that data is guarenteed to arrive and to arrive only once. Reliable delivery
                typically requires more processing, more memory (as packets need to be stored in case they need resending), 
                a larger number of protocol bytes and can be slower than unreliable delivery.

            <remarks>
                Fragmented messages allow large amounts of data to be transmitted in smaller chunks when using connections 
                that do not support the transmission of large messages. By specifying reliable delivery messages are 
                guaranteed to arrive and to arrive only once but the sending process may require more memory, processing,
                a larger number protocol bytes and may be slower than sending unreliably.
